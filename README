IDNA::Punycode - conversion from IDN domain names to Punycode and back
======================================================================

1. DESCRIPTION
--------------

IDNA::Punycode will convert a domain-name from the "native" IDN
(Internationalized Domain Name) form, i.e., a domain-name
containing non-ASCII characters, into it's corresponding
ACE (ASCII Compatible Encoding), and vice versa.

Before you do the ACE conversion, however, you must first "normalize"
the string to convert using Net::IDN::Nameprep.  See RFC3940
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3490.txt) for more information.

IDNA::Punycode has no dependencies.
